# XSets with Representative Value

[XSets](https://github.com/chiguri/XSets) are the extended MSets in the standard library.
In this library, sets store "representative values" instead of given values.
This makes possible to use another equality to judge an element in a set.
Such "representative values" are often distinguishable with faster decision procedure.
